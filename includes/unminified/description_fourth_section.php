                        <h1>The Graph Panel<br><h6 style="margin-top:-30px;font-size:12px;">ANALYTICS, GRAPH</h6></h1>

                        <p>This is the most confusing but mindblowing part of CalcMate. This the Panel that Graphically represents your mathematical equations (basically SIMULTANEOUS EQUATIONS). As we explained how to define the values for X and Y axis from the advanced panel; take for example: 5X-6Y=8, mathematically, this simultaneous equation when plotted on a Graph should show a line that slops upwards from the X-axis towards the Y-axis. After writing this equation 5X-6Y=8, swipe back to this panel and wait for a sec for the graphical representation!.</p>

                        <p>Use the + button at the bottom row of this Panel to ZoomIn the Graph Board (relatively making the board smaller), Use the - button at the bottom row of this Panel to ZoomOut the Graph Board (relatively making the board smaller), then, Use the scale button (third button) at the bottom row of this Panel to scale the Graph Board to 1:1 (relatively making the board fit).</p>
